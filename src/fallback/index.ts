/**
 * SemText — fallback tier entry point.
 *
 * This module and everything it imports must stay free of Lit. It ships as
 * `dist/semtext-fallback.js`, a classic IIFE script that runs standalone in a
 * document that never loads the component bundle: the fallback tier is what
 * makes a portable `file://` document interactive with zero network.
 *
 * TIER HANDOFF. Each handler marks what it wired with `data-sem-fallback`.
 * When the Lit bundle is also present, `SemElement.connectedCallback` claims
 * `data-sem-upgraded` and clears that marker, and every hide-rule in the
 * theme CSS is gated on one marker or the other — so with neither script
 * running, nothing is hidden and the document reads as plain prose. The
 * document root (`<html>`) carries the same marker once `enhance` has run,
 * for hide rules whose host element is deliberately unmarked (a list-view
 * deck's distractors).
 *
 * SIZE BUDGET: 14 KB minified — raised from 8 KB in the reading-experience
 * W0 wave (deep-link resolver + audience gating), to 13 KB for the
 * sem-source snapshot, and to 14 KB when the canonical tag form became a
 * first-class input of every handler (`:is(sem-x, .sem-x)` selectors, the
 * bare→data-* attribute mirror, the tag-form note body wrap). Raw bytes are what a
 * file:// document carries, since nothing gzips an inlined <script>, so the
 * budget is stated raw. Most of the weight is irreducible string literals:
 * markup templates, class names and warning text. `scripts/build.mjs`
 * prints measured size against its budget on every build; raise it
 * deliberately, never silently.
