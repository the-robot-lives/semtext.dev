# Schema — `sem-source`

Contract per conventions.md v0.5. BDD source of truth for
`test/e2e/sem-source.cy.js`. Changes here precede spec changes precede code.

## Scope semantics

A transparent wrapper around ordinary SemText content that lets a reader
flip between the **rendered** section and its **markup as parsed, before
any enhancement** (the pre-enhancement serialisation of the section)
of the same section. It exists for documents that teach or demonstrate the
vocabulary: the reader sees what a fact deck renders as, then sees exactly
what was written to get it, without a second copy of the markup that could
drift. It is a wrapper, not content: it mints no record, its children
extract exactly as they would without it, and a document without it loses
nothing a machine could read. The verbatim source is the one thing it adds,
and that is a *derived* view of the children, never a second authoring.

Minting justification (conventions): an interaction (the toggle), a field
(the verbatim markup shown in the fence) and a degradation behaviour (HTML
only, nothing hidden, JS-off).

## Authoring form

```html
<sem-source id="s-facts" label="Facts — flashcards">
  <h2>Facts — flashcards</h2>
  <sem-facts view-as="flashcards">…</sem-facts>
</sem-source>
```

Class-form alias (conventions Appendix A): `div.sem-source[data-label][data-view-as]` with the same children.
Parameters are read as `data-<name>` first, then bare `<name>`.

- Children: any SemText content — vocabulary elements, headings, prose.
  `sem-source` must not nest inside another `sem-source` (the inner one's
  markup is part of the outer one's source; the inner toggle is undefined).
- `view-as` (optional): `html` (default) or `source` — the initial
  mode. **Mutable presentation**: the toggle rewrites `data-view-as` at
  runtime (the authored bare attribute is left alone), and extraction
  ignores it (spec/extraction.md §5c).
- `label` (optional): a short caption rendered in the chrome.
- `id`, `audience` per the global catalog. `kind` / `tags` are **not**
  honoured on the wrapper: a wrapper carrying them would mint a plain
  record under the minting test, and this element is defined to mint
  nothing, so extraction treats `sem-source` as never minting regardless.

## Rendered form

### Fallback

Two scripts share the work, because the raw markup must be captured before
any behaviour has touched it and the fence needs `sem-code`, which lives
in the reading bundle.

**Core fallback (`dist/semtext-fallback.js`) — snapshot, registered
FIRST.** Before any other handler runs, every `sem-source` receives a
child `<template class="sem-source-raw">` whose content is a DOM clone of
the element's children as they stood at that moment — the section before
chrome, before line spans, before any `hidden`. The snapshot is nodes,
never a string: nothing is serialised and re-parsed, so there is no HTML
sink and no `</script` escaping; the fence text is a serialisation of the
clone (`template.innerHTML` read). It is the parser's serialisation, not
the file's bytes: attribute quoting and order, self-closing forms and
entity spelling follow the DOM, so the fence is "the document as parsed",
never a byte-for-byte copy of the source file. Idempotent: an element that
already has a snapshot is left alone; a wrapper nested in another wrapper
is skipped with a console warning (unsupported); the reading bundle gives
it no chrome either, so the outer wrapper owns it. Template content is not
part of the document tree, so it is inert, invisible, unreachable by CSS
and `querySelectorAll`, and skipped by extraction. Lit elements claim
`data-sem-upgraded` at parse time (anti-flash gating needs it) and the
fence strips that marker when it renders; every other attribute a Lit
element writes is deferred until the parse has finished
(`SemElement.afterParse`), i.e. after the snapshot, so the fence is the
authored markup. An authored `<\/script` sequence and a real end tag both
round-trip as written, because nothing is escaped.

**Reading bundle (`dist/semtext-reading.js`) — chrome and fence.**

- `.sem-source-chrome` is inserted as the element's **first child**:
  `role="group"`, `aria-label="View as"`; an optional `.sem-source-label`
  caption (from `data-label`); then two `button[type="button"]`s in fixed
  order — `button[data-act="html"]` labelled `Rendered` and
  `button[data-act="source"]` labelled `Source` — each with `aria-pressed`
  reflecting the current mode.
- Activating `Source` builds the fence **once**: a `.sem-source-fence`
  appended as the element's last child, holding one class-form
  `div.sem-code[data-lang="html"][data-controls="copy,wrap"]` whose
  `<pre><code>` text is the snapshot with the parse-time tier markers
  removed as attributes (on a parsed clone, never by string replacement),
  the section's common leading indentation removed **outside**
  preformatted ranges (`<pre>`, `<textarea>` content is verbatim), and
  leading/trailing blank lines trimmed. The fence's `sem-code`
  is enhanced by the same `enhanceCodeElement` the reading bundle uses, so
  copy and wrap work in it. `textContent` only — the markup is never
  parsed as HTML on the way in.
- Mode is `data-view-as` on the element: `source` shows the fence and
  hides every other child except the chrome; anything else (or absent)
  shows the children and hides the fence. Toggling sets `data-view-as`
  to `source` or `html` and updates both buttons' `aria-pressed`.
- An authored `data-view-as="source"` (either form) builds the fence at
  enhance time and starts in source mode.
- The fence is built at most once; switching back and forth shows and
  hides it. Nothing is persisted. Focus stays on the activated button.
- A deep link or outline link into a wrapper in source mode (the target
  may be the wrapper or any descendant — the resolver walks every
  ancestor) switches it back to rendered first (fallback core
  `target.ts`): through the chrome's `Rendered` button when the reading
  bundle built one, else by setting `data-view-as="html"` directly, so
  the core keeps its reveal contract on its own.
- Without a snapshot (a document that loaded the reading bundle but not
  the core) the fence reads `innerHTML` at build time, chrome and all,
  and a console warning names the cause — recorded limit; ship both
  scripts.
- The element carries `data-sem-fallback` once wired.

### Upgraded (Lit `SemSource`)

- Thin wrapper: claims `data-sem-upgraded`, clears `data-sem-fallback`,
  and once the document has finished parsing (so the core's snapshot pass
  has run) calls the same enhance function the bundle uses. Idempotent on
  the chrome's presence.

### JS-off

- The children render as HTML, in flow, exactly as if the wrapper were
  absent. No chrome, no fence, no snapshot, nothing hidden — the hide rule
  is gated on a tier marker like every other hide rule (conventions §4.4),
  so `data-view-as="source"` authored on a JS-off page still shows the
  rendered content.
- Print: the rendered children, chrome and fence hidden, whatever mode the
  reader was in.

## Events

None.

## A11y contract

- The chrome is a `role="group"` labelled `View as`; the two modes are
  real `<button type="button">`s with visible text and `aria-pressed`, so
  the pair reads as a two-state segmented control.
- The fence inherits `sem-code`'s contract: copy announces through its
  status region; an overflowing `<pre>` is focusable and labelled.
- Switching mode moves nothing off the accessibility tree that the reader
  did not ask to hide, and focus stays on the button that was activated.

## Machine contract

- **Mints nothing, transparent.** `sem-source` is not a record type and
  is exempt from the plain-record minting test; extraction descends into
  its children as if the wrapper were not there, so the record array of a
  document is identical with and without the wrapper, and identical in
  `html` and `source` mode.
- Skipped whole (chrome, never text): `.sem-source-chrome`,
  `.sem-source-fence` (and therefore the `sem-code` inside it — the fence
  is a derived view, not a listing the author wrote), `.sem-source-raw`.
- `data-view-as` on the element is presentation (§5c); `data-sem-fallback`
  / `data-sem-upgraded` are session state (§5b).
